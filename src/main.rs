/// The goal of calc isn't to run a full simulation of play at a holdem poker table. It's
/// to provide a quick tool that can calculate odds and outs for a specific combination of hands.
///
/// NOTE ON PERSPECTIVE (double dummy)
///
/// We are taking the all knowing view of play, granted to us by modern poker TV shows, pioneered
/// by [Henry Orenstein](https://www.usbets.com/remembering-poker-pioneer-henry-orenstein/).
///
/// ## Step One
///
/// We want to be able to take the cards dealt, and display them representing the hole cards
/// for each of the players.
///
/// ## Step Two
///
/// Show me who has the best hand at the flop
///
/// The hand:
/// `❯ cargo run -- -d "6♠ 6♥ 5♦ 5♣" -b "9♣ 6♦ 5♥ 5♠ 8♠"`
///
/// To add logging:
/// RUST_LOG=trace cargo run -- -d "6♠ 6♥ 5♦ 5♣" -b "9♣ 6♦ 5♥ 5♠ 8♠"
///
/// What about calling this hand The Fold?
/// RUST_LOG=trace cargo run -- -d  "5♠ 5♦ 9♠ 9♥ K♣ T♦" -b "5♣ 9♦ T♥ T♣ Q♦"
///
/// ## Step Three
///
/// Show me the winning percentages for each hand at the flop.
///
/// At this point I am starting to feel the strain on my system from my main method
/// trying to do too much. This is when I try to build code that will take the load
/// off and make things easier to maintain and build upon.
///
/// ## Step Four - Calc Structure
///
/// We're reaching the point in our code where the repl is doing to much...maintaining too
/// much state. Our `Game` struct was designed to simply hold all the cards that were needed
/// for the game.
///
/// For now, I want to get all the ducks in a row. Two things that I am missing:
/// * An ordered list of the possible hands at the flop.
/// * A collection of all types of possible hands for a player at the flop.
///
/// ## PHASE 3.1: Outs
///
/// Now that we have the win percentages displayed at the flop, we need to add the icing on the cake:
/// player outs. One of the clearest ways to display the meaning behind the odds is to show the
/// cards that the player behind on the hand would need in order to win.
///
/// Since our calc example is starting to take on a lot of business logic, this may be a good time
/// to do some refactoring and move it into dedicated structs.
///
/// Calculating win percentages and outs should be part of the same iteration through the possible
/// cases. I'm feeling the need to break this problem down with a spike in our example hear and
/// see where it leads us.
///
/// The structure that I am thinking to hold each of the player's outs is simple:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(Clone, Debug, Default, Eq, PartialEq)]
/// pub struct Outs(Vec<Cards>);
/// ```
///
/// `cargo run -- -d "A♠ K♥ 8♦ 6♣" -b "A♣ 8♥ 7♥ 9♠ 5♠" -n`
///
/// Interesting hands:
/// cargo run -- -d "3♥ A♠ 5♥ A♦ 8♦ 7♦ K♥ K♠ 2♥ Q♠" -b "6♦ 6♣ 7♣ 9♦ 5♦" - Straight Flush at the river
/// cargo run -- -d "3♠ 9♦ J♠ 8♦ 2♠ Q♠ 6♣ 4♠" -b "Q♥ 5♥ 5♣ 7♥ 4♥" -- Two Pair vs Straight Draw
